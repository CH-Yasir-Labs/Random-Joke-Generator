# Random-Joke-Generator
This Python script fetches a random joke from the **JokeAPI** and displays it. It sends a request to the API, handles errors gracefully, and prints the joke if available. Using `requests`, it ensures smooth retrieval while handling connectivity issues. A simple, fun program to get a quick laugh anytime! ðŸ˜†
